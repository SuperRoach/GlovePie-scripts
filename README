A collection of script(s) to make GlovePie more useful. 
I am focusing on the popular Wiimote for the interface.

	- XSplit-pieceof.pie
A interface using a wiimote for using XSplit. 

Features:
The directional buttons control what scene you are viewing, with the LED indicating what scene you are on 
(you are needed to set the hotkeys in the script to match your assigned hotkeys in XSplit).

If you are doing using a two pc style setup for recording, or the XSplit window open, 
it will check the current recording status, Rumbling in different ways (1 = Recording, 2 = Stopped) 
as a subtle indicator of recording started or stopped. 

Buttons 1/2 are mapped to mouse clicks when used as a teleprompter or for slides.

Optional pacing feature to have the LEDs blink at a defined interval for practicing timing an rehearsals.


	- Use
- Get Glovepie from:	
http://glovepie.org/ (recommend 0.43 if you want to avoid bloat from Kinect SDK)

- Add the wiimote to your bluetooh equipped PC (crash course: bluetooth - add device, 
hold 1+2 to make it discoverable, add wiimote without a passkey)

- Using GlovePie, open a script and Click "Start".  The leds should change, and be functional now.
